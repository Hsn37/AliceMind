## Introduction
We present mPLUG-Owl, a new training paradigm with a modularized design for large multi-modal language models. Learns visual knowledge while support multi-turn conversation consisting of different modalities. Observed abilities such as multi-image correlation and scene text understanding, vision-based document comprehension. Release a visually-related instruction evaluation set OwlEval
